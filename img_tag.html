            The dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf.
            Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves,
            [6][7] and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.
            [8] Dogs were the first species to be domesticated[9][8]
            by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago[7] before the development of agriculture.
            [1] Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[10]
            and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[11]

            Static images are literally visual images that do not move.
            They include greeting cards, posters, slides, photographs, paintings, compact disc covers,
            comics, cartoons, charts, collages, models, dioramas, newspapers, and print advertisements.

            The intensity of a pixel is expressed within a given range between a minimum and a maximum,
            inclusive. This range is represented in an abstract way as a range from 0 (or 0%) (total absence, black)
            and 1 (or 100%) (total presence, white), with any fractional values in between. 
            This notation is used in academic papers, but this does not define what "black" or "white" is in terms
            of colorimetry. Sometimes the scale is reversed, as in printing where the numeric intensity denotes
            how much ink is employed in halftoning, with 0% representing the paper white (no ink) and 100% being
            a solid black (full ink).
